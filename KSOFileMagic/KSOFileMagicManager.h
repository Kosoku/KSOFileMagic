/**
 KSOFileMagicManager provides an interface to the Darwin file command, which can examine the contents of a file to determine its type. This is useful if the file URL or path does not provide a file extension from which to determine the type. Similarly, if you have raw data, from a network request for example, its contents can be inspected to determine its type.
 
 For methods that take a NSURL or NSString, if a file extension is available, the UTType family of functions are used to determine the attributes before falling back to file I/O.
